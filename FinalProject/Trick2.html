	<h1>The Cup Trick</h1>
	<p>The cup trick comes in many forms and dates back to egyption times, Penn and Teller have modernized the trick recently. <br>
	The original way the trick is done is by palming various objects and pretending to place them under cups.<br>
	in reality the objects were never placed to begin with, however the visual is that the object dissapears from the cup.<br>
	Many people use other cups to make it seem like the objects are jumping from one cup to another, and sometimes will even palm other-<br>
	objects of various sizes to create a more visual illusion. Such as moving from a ping pong ball to a baseball to an orange.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Penn and Teller has slightly altered this trick to make a cup dissapear instead. While they still have the original mastered, the cups dissapearance is a refreashing change for sure.<br>
	The trick requires a table and you essentially put your object under the cup, and cover the cup in a paper towel.<br>
	You pretend to try to make the object inside the cup dissapear. You hit the top of the cup AND... nothing happens. <br>
	You do it again!....Nothing. Finally you hit it a final time and the cup dissapears, the object still there you must admit to the crowd.<br>
	You couldnt make the object dissapear.<br>
	In reality to preform the trick all you are doing is moving the cup (preferably plastic) above your lap in a seated position.<br>
	the paper towel will hold its form as you release the cup silently into your lap, the crowd distracted with the token that hasnt dissapeared yet.<br>
	Finally when you go to pat the cup a final time the cups gone. Whereas the coin isnt. A simple trick but not thought of often.
