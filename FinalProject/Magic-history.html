	<h1>(A Short) History</h1>
	<p>Magic has always been a spactacular form of entertainment since even before Ancient Egypt.
		 The charisma that goes into every trick, which is then mixed with a story and a bit of slight of Hand
		is what creates many of what you know magic to be today!<br>
		Card magic in particular is a huge one that wows many from all around,
		afterall, most people know at least one card game. The very visual 
		affects that cards give also portray a very mystical feeling when
		the tricks are done right.<br>
		Many feel like they should know what had happened but cannot even put their
		finger close to the answer! And that is just one example of many types of magic.
