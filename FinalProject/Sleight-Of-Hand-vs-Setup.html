	<h1>Sleight-Of-Hand-vs-Setup</h1>
	<p>This is quite simple in all honesty<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Sleight-Of-Hand is just that, its sleight of hand, the way the hands move, the way the objects are placed, everything done in the trick is usually some form of slight of hand.
	<br>
	The only time there is any real exception is when its a set-up trick as they are premade or preset to ensure the trick works each and every time.
	<br>
	<br>
	A Technical Trick is purely slight of hand, usually little to no set up at all and can be preformed with almost any oject that meets the conditions.<br>
	A setup trick can often be much more astounding than technical tricks, however in order to pull the set-up tricks off you usually need some form of technical know how.
